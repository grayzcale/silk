SILK is an intricate game development framework designed to streamline the overall process of game development. With its simple yet effective stage-execution model, the SILK lifecycle enables developers to effectively manage large pieces of code with ease, keeping everything well-organized. This framework is highly versatile and flexibleâ€”adaptable to all development workflows and preferences. With the introduction of *packages*, developers are given the ability to develop code in a non-destructive manner, quickly producing more reliable and predictable results. The framework also includes pre-written packages involving the standard core functionalities for any typical project.

- Provides a consistent interface between scripts to access shared data or functionality, avoiding duplication of effort and reducing the amount of code needed to accomplish a particular task, ultimately simplifying the overall process of development

- Ensures effective communication between scripts in a controlled manner by having a centralized point of access for data and functionality, reducing the risk of bugs, conflicts, or other inconsistencies in the codebase

- Simplifies game development workflows with better organization and flexibility through a highly modular ecosystem, giving the ability to modify different components of the project in a non-destructive manner

</div>

An intuitive game development framework for Roblox designed to streamline the process of game development

- Provides a consistent interface between scripts to access shared data or functionality, avoiding duplication of effort and reduce the amount of code needed to accomplish a particular task, ultimately simplifying the overall process of development

- Ensure effective communication between scripts in a controlled manner by having a centralized point of access for data and functionality, reducing the risk of bugs, conflicts, or other inconsistencies in the codebase

- Simplified game development workflows with better organization and flexibility through a highly modular ecosystem, obtaining the ability to modify different components of the project in a non-destructive manner

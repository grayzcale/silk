# About

SILK is an intricate game development framework designed to streamline the overall process of game development. With its simple yet effective stage-execution model, the SILK lifecycle enables developers to effectively manage large pieces of code with ease, keeping everything well-organized. This framework is highly versatile and flexibleâ€”adaptable to all development workflows and preferences. With the introduction of *packages*, developers are given the ability to develop code in a non-destructive manner, quickly producing more reliable and predictable results. The framework also includes pre-written packages involving the standard core functionalities for any typical project.

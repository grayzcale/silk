# About

SILK is a Roblox game framework that aims to simplify the game development process. The simple stage-execution model of SILK enables developers to manage stage execution in an organized manner. Moreover, SILK is highly adaptable to any type of development workflow and preferences. It also introduces Packages, which provide a structured way to manage codebase and its functionality. With packages, developers are able to maintain and develop code in a non-destrive manner, making the execution far more reliable and predictable. Pre-written packages that provide core functionality are also included by default in the framework.

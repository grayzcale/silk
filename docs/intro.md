# About

SILK is an intricate game development framework designed to streamline the overall process of game development. The SILK lifecyle, with its simple yet effective stage-execution model, enables developers to effectively manage large pieces of code with ease, keeping everything well-organized. This framework is highly versatile and flexibleâ€”adaptable to all types of different development workflows and preferences. With the introduction of *packages*, developers are given the ability of developing code in a non-destructive manner, quickly producing more reliable and predictable results. The framework also includes pre-written packages involving the common core functionalities for any typical project.
